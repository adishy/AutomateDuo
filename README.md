# Duo Auto Accept
### *Disclaimer:*  Use this at your own risk. Automating two factor authentication will reduce security and nullify any advantages provided by it

This document is aimed at providing a solution on Android devices for the annoying number of 2FA requests caused by trying to login to any University of Michigan service. Please note that using this script is as good as *not* having 2FA enabled, so do consider the security implications before proceeding. 

## Android
* Install [Duo Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile&hl=en_US) on your device and set up your account normally as per this [ITS document](https://documentation.its.umich.edu/2fa/enroll-smartphone-or-tablet-duo). If you are already using Duo Mobile on your device you can skip this step

* Download [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_US) from the Play Store ($2.99)

* Download [AutoNotification](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autonotification&hl=en_US)
    * AutoNotification is a plugin for Tasker that enhances Tasker's ability to manipulate and interact with notifications
    * AutoNotification is part of [AutoApps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoappshub&hl=en_US), a family of plugins developed by [joaomgcd](https://joaoapps.com/)
    * AutoNotification is free with ads and an ad-free version can also be purchased through the AutoApps app 

* Download the [DuoAutoAccept.tsk.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adishy/AutomateDuo/master/DuoAutoAccept.tsk.xml) from the repository

* Import the task into Tasker (long press the Tasks tab)

* Once you have imported the task you should see it listed under the Tasks tab with the name "T"

</p>

* Feel free to open the task and look at and modify the steps used to automate the process
    * If the script takes too long/fails to work correctly, try to tweak the time interval in Step 4

* To link the task to the Duo Mobile app, we must first create a profile that listens for a Notification UI Event and then runs the task when the appropriate event was fired. To do this, first add a new profile

 <p align="center">

* Your phone should now accept any Duo Mobile Notifications automatically.







Notes: I have updated this so that the script will now work with the UI change. I have also noted that your phone must be on and logged in for this to work.
